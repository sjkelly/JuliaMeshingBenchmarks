# MeshingBenchmarks

A set of real-world benchmarks for isosurface extraction using the Meshing.jl library.

Benchmarks are similar to those in: [Flying Edges: A High-Performance Scalable Isocontouring Algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282975362_Flying_Edges_A_High-Performance_Scalable_Isocontouring_Algorithm) by Shroeder, Maynard, and Geveci. DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.1.3415.9609 

## CT-angio
Anonymized CT angiography scan at resolution
of (512 × 512 × 321), with 16-bit scalar values. q = 100.
